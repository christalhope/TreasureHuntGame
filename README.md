Treasure hunt game with pirate agent vs human player

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The work done on this project consisted of code provided from the instructor that includes the classes TreasureMaze.py characterizes a maze object which is defined by the 8x8 matrix, GameExperience.py object represents the experiences of the agent in terms of getting data, remember information about the environment, making predictions and so on. The work completed on this project was in the Jupyter Notebook where the Q-Algorithm had to be completed with pseudocode to assist in finishing the algorithm.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
Throughout the course, I was able to learn different techniques and features within the world of AI; I've learned about neural networks and how they contribute to a wide variety of AI solutions in business and entertainment currently. It was intriguing to learn about AI concepts and perhaps what I've learned in this course will attract the eyes of AI specialists one day. 
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer Scientists are ultimately responsible for designing and analyzing software/hardware solutions that offer convenience in some way to the field of business, science, society and more. Without computer science, it's hard to imagine what the world would look like. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I feel that its important to approach problems with an open mind and then identify the issue needing to be solved and get to work. It is crucial as a computer scientist that we understand the problem entirely; This is what helps to solve it later down the road. After having comprehension about the problem and what it introduces allows me to develop different methods that could provide a solution to the problem: Moreover, if the chosen solution is not successful, the process is repeated until a working solution is found.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities include protecting the end user and the organization that employs me. To achieve security, it is my duty to follow industry standard practices and techniques; Furthermore, I will ensure that I'm responsible in reporting issues that I cannot solve.
